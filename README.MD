Very simple and minimalistic Model & View & Controller framework for Java applications. Allows routing of requests to simple Java Beans and automatically resolving into simple text or json views. It's using esprit-injector under cover to instatiate beans.

This is really alpha release not recommended to be used on production. But feel free to experiment and submit pull requests in case you find a bug or have an idea about any missing and useful feature.

## Getting Started

Clone and compile with maven - ie. mvn eclipse:eclipse to import to eclipse or 'mvn install' to add to local repository. I'll add a real maven repo little bit later.
